Hi everyone, I'm Katamuto!

I started writing this program with the purpose of being a substitute for the popular "Balabolka" reading program. Which I use a lot to listen to my favorite books while I do some other activity on the PC.

Although for now it is very simple, I hope to continue improving it in the future.

In the meantime, feel free to use and modify its code however you like. All I ask is that you share your possible improvements so that we can enrich the world of free software.

I don't have a specific work schedule or structure. I'll just add whatever you need when you need it. But this is a small list of the improvements that I want it to have (and will have) in the indeterminate future.

-Compatibility with other TTS (For now it only works with Festival).
-Option to choose the voice and language.
-Playback speed control.
-Export playback in an audio file.
-Custom dictionaries to replace words.
-Support for digital book formats (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, etc)
-Remember reading progress.

That is the minimum to which I aspire.

Greetings to all. And enjoy it!
